The **Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group** is a `community
<people/main.html>`_ of nuclear engineers, scientists, programmers and
students who focus on the development of `reliable software tools
<projects/software.html>`_ for the analysis of complex nuclear systems.

Two primary `areas of activity <projects/main.html>`_ are:

* radiation transport and effects in complex CAD-based geometries, and
* agent-based modeling of advanced nuclear fuel cycles.

The acronym CNERG is intended to be pronounced like the English word synergy
('si-n&r-jE). According to `Merriam-Webster OnLine`_, the noun synergy means
"a mutually advantageous conjunction or compatibility of distinct business
participants or elements". This name is suggestive of many synergies that we
take advantage of both inside our CNERG community and with our connections to
others.
